        "\n",
        "The five key concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "***Encapsulation:*** This is the bundling of data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of an object's components, which is done by using access modifiers like private, protected, and public. This helps protect the object's state and only allows controlled access through methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "***Abstraction:*** Abstraction hides the complex implementation details and exposes only the essential features of an object. It allows a programmer to focus on high-level mechanisms rather than low-level implementation. For example, an interface or abstract class is used to define the operations, but the actual implementation is done by subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "***Inheritance:***This is the mechanism where a new class (subclass or derived class) can inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between the parent and child classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "***Polymorphism:*** Polymorphism means \"many forms.\" It allows a single method or operator to work in different ways based on the objects it is acting upon. There are two types of polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "***Compile-time*** (Method Overloading): Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.\n",
        "Run-time (Method Overriding): A subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
        "Composition: This refers to the practice of creating complex objects by combining simpler objects, instead of inheriting from other classes. This is often described as a \"has-a\" relationship, where an object is composed of other objects that represent parts of the whole. It helps in making the code more modular and flexible."
