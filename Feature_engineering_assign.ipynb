        "An optimizer is an algorithm or method used to adjust the parameters of a machine learning model to minimize the loss function. By doing so, optimizers help improve the model's performance during training by finding the best values for the model's weights.\n",
        "**Different Types of Optimizers:**\n",
        "\n",

        "Description: This is a variant of gradient descent where the model's parameters are updated using only a single example (or a small batch) from the training dataset at a time.\n",
        "Example: If you have a large dataset, instead of calculating the gradient of the loss function using the entire dataset, you randomly pick one data point, compute the gradient, and update the weights accordingly. This can lead to faster convergence but may also introduce noise in the updates.\n",

        "**Momentum:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Description: This method uses the concept of momentum from physics, which helps accelerate the SGD process in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations. It adds a fraction of the previous update to the current update.\n",
        "Example: If you previously moved a certain distance in a direction, the next step will consider that distance plus the gradient of the current step.   \n",
        "\n",

        "**AdaGrad (Adaptive Gradient Algorithm):**\n",
        "\n",
        "Description: This optimizer adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the historical gradient information. Parameters that have received larger gradients will have their learning rates reduced, and vice versa.\n",
        "Example: If a parameter is often updated with large gradients, its learning rate decreases quickly, allowing the algorithm to converge faster in sparse data scenarios.    \n",

        "Description: RMSprop is an improvement over AdaGrad that maintains a moving average of the squared gradients and uses that to normalize the updates. It works well in non-stationary environments.\n",
        "Example: Often used in training RNNs, RMSprop helps in handling the vanishing gradient problem by preventing the learning rate from becoming too small.\n",

For example, in linear regression, the coefficients of the features are calculated based on their relative importance, and if one feature is much larger than the others, it can dominate the model and make it less accurate. By scaling the features, the model can better compare the relative importance of each feature and make more accurate predictions.\n",
